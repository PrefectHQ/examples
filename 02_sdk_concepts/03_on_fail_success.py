# ## Responding intelligently to flow outcomes
# 
# Great data workflows don't just execute stepsâ€”they respond intelligently to 
# both success and failure conditions. Whether you're running critical ETL jobs,
# ML model training, or scheduled reports, you need visibility when things go right
# and rapid response when they don't.
# 
# Prefect's callback system provides a clean, declarative way to handle both outcomes:
# 
# ```python
# @flow(
#     on_success=notify_team_success,  # Called when flow completes successfully
#     on_failure=alert_ops_team,       # Called when flow fails
# )
# def my_important_workflow():
#     ...
# ```
# 
# ### What are callbacks?
# 
# Callbacks are Python functions that execute at specific flow lifecycle points:
# 
# * **on_success** â€“ runs after successful completion (COMPLETED state)
# * **on_failure** â€“ runs after failure (FAILED state)
# 
# Each callback receives two arguments:
# 1. The flow object itself
# 2. The final Prefect State object (with runtime, result, and details)
# 
# Because callbacks execute in the same process as your flow, they have access to
# your entire Python environmentâ€”perfect for sending webhooks, logging to external
# systems, or triggering downstream processes.
# 
# ### Real-world applications
# 
# * **Data quality monitoring**: Send success metrics to your observability platform
# * **DevOps integration**: Create JIRA tickets automatically when pipelines fail
# * **Team communication**: Push alerts to Slack/Teams when critical flows need attention
# * **Resource management**: Clean up cloud resources regardless of flow outcome
# * **Workflow orchestration**: Chain dependent flows together on success
# 
# In this example, we'll implement two callbacks that attach to a GitHub repository 
# stats flow. One handles successful completion by displaying runtime metrics, while
# the other creates a diagnostic message when the flow fails.

# ### What just happened?
# The flow finished and Prefect executed the appropriate callback based on the
# final state:
# â€¢ If everything succeeded, `log_success` printed a green checkâ€‘mark with the
#   total runtime.
# â€¢ If any task failed and retries were exhausted, `log_failure` printed a red
#   alert along with the flowâ€‘run IDâ€”perfect for copyâ€‘pasting into the UI.
#
# ### Why does this matter?
# Callbacks give you a single, declarative place to hook monitoring, alerting,
# or cleanup logicâ€”separating *business* code from *operational* concerns.  No
# more scattering `try/except` blocks or forgotten Slack calls throughout your
# pipeline; Prefect guarantees thie callback runs exactly once per flow run.
