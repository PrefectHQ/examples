# Prefect Examples

This repo contains examples of how to use Prefect.

## Motivation

This repository collects useful code examples that emerge from user interactions. By centralizing these examples, we can better share and reuse solutions across the team, ultimately improving our ability to help users efficiently.

These examples are intentionally lightweight starting points rather than complete solutions, making them easy to adapt for different customer needs.

We should track success through:
- Team contribution frequency: Regular sharing of solutions from user interactions
- Internal adoption: Reuse of examples across different user scenarios
