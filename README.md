# Prefect Examples

These are examples that show how to use Prefect. They include the source code for our tutorials as well as various other ways to use Prefect. They are intended to be simple starting points rather than complete solutions. We hope that you will find them useful!

## Development

This repository uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management. To set up pre-commit checks, run `uvx pre-commit`.
