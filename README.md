# Prefect Examples

These are examples that show how to use Prefect. They are intended to be simple starting points rather than complete solutions. We hope that you will find them useful!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for python environment management.

If you've cloned the repository, you can run any of the examples with `uv run flows/<example_name>.py`, for example:

```bash
uv run flows/hello_world.py
```

If you haven't, you can point `uv run` at the url of the python file, for example:

```bash
uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrefectHQ/examples/refs/heads/main/flows/hello_world.py
```



## Development

To set up pre-commit checks, run `uvx pre-commit`.
