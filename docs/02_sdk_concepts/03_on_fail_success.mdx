## Responding intelligently to flow outcomes

Great data workflows don't just execute stepsâ€”they respond intelligently to 
both success and failure conditions. Whether you're running critical ETL jobs,
ML model training, or scheduled reports, you need visibility when things go right
and rapid response when they don't.

Prefect's callback system provides a clean, declarative way to handle both outcomes:

```python
@flow(
    on_success=notify_team_success,  # Called when flow completes successfully
    on_failure=alert_ops_team,       # Called when flow fails
)
def my_important_workflow():
    ...
```

### What are callbacks?

Callbacks are Python functions that execute at specific flow lifecycle points:

* **on_success** â€“ runs after successful completion (COMPLETED state)
* **on_failure** â€“ runs after failure (FAILED state)

Each callback receives two arguments:
1. The flow object itself
2. The final Prefect State object (with runtime, result, and details)

Because callbacks execute in the same process as your flow, they have access to
your entire Python environmentâ€”perfect for sending webhooks, logging to external
systems, or triggering downstream processes.

For more details, see Prefect's callback documentation:
<https://docs.prefect.io/v3/develop/manage-states>

### When should you use callbacks?
* **Monitoring & Alerting** â€“ Get Slack/Teams alerts when critical pipelines fail
* **Cleanup tasks** â€“ Ensure resources (temp files, clusters) are cleaned regardless of outcome
* **Workflow chaining** â€“ Trigger downstream flows only when upstream succeeds
* **Metadata reporting** â€“ Push run metrics to observability tools on success

In this example, we'll implement two callbacks that attach to a GitHub repository 
stats flow. One handles successful completion by displaying runtime metrics, while
the other creates a diagnostic message when the flow fails.

```python
import httpx
from prefect import flow, task


```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

```python
def log_failure(flow_obj, state):
    """Callback executed when the flow ends in a FAILED state."""

    print(
        "\nðŸš¨ Flow FAILED â€“ "
        f"name={flow_obj.name!r} â€¢ run_id={state.state_details.flow_run_id}"
    )


def log_success(flow_obj, state):
    """Callback executed when the flow ends in a COMPLETED state."""

    duration = state.state_details.duration  # seconds
    print(
        "\nâœ… Flow SUCCEEDED â€“ "
        f"name={flow_obj.name!r} â€¢ duration={duration:.2f}s"
    )


@task(retries=2, retry_delay_seconds=5)
def get_repo_info(repo_owner: str, repo_name: str):
    """Get info about a repo - will retry twice after failing"""
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}"
    api_response = httpx.get(url)
    api_response.raise_for_status()
    repo_info = api_response.json()
    return repo_info

@task(retries=2, retry_delay_seconds=5)
def get_contributors(repo_info: dict):
    """Get contributors for a repo"""
    contributors_url = repo_info["contributors_url"]
    response = httpx.get(contributors_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    contributors = response.json()
    return contributors

@flow(
    name="github-repo-stats-with-callbacks",
    log_prints=True,
    retries=2,
    retry_delay_seconds=5,
    on_failure=log_failure,
    on_success=log_success,
)
def repo_info(repo_owner: str = "PrefectHQ", repo_name: str = "prefect"):
    """
    Given a GitHub repository, logs the number of stargazers
    and contributors for that repo.
    """
    repo_info = get_repo_info(repo_owner, repo_name)
    print(f"Stars ðŸŒ  : {repo_info['stargazers_count']}")

    contributors = get_contributors(repo_info)
    print(f"Number of contributors ðŸ‘·: {len(contributors)}")

```

### Why This Is Important
Callbacks give you a single, declarative place to hook monitoring, alerting,
or cleanup logicâ€”separating *business* code from *operational* concerns.  No
more scattering `try/except` blocks or forgotten Slack calls throughout your
pipeline; Prefect guarantees thie callback runs exactly once per flow run.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    repo_info()

```
