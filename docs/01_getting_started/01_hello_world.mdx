# Welcome to Prefect!

Prefect helps you build, run, and monitor reliable data workflows. Let's start with 
the simplest possible example – a "Hello, world!" flow that greets someone by name.

### What is a flow?

In Prefect, a **flow** is the main building block of your workflows. It's simply a 
Python function decorated with `@flow`:

```python
@flow
def my_workflow():
    # Your workflow logic here
    pass
```

Flows can contain regular Python code, call other flows, orchestrate tasks, handle 
errors gracefully, and much more. They give you:

* **Automatic logging** – Track inputs, outputs, and runtime
* **State management** – Monitor progress through the UI
* **Observability** – Gain insights into performance and failures
* **Resilience** – Add retries and error handling with minimal code
* **Scheduling** – Run workflows on any schedule

### Installing Prefect

For this example, you only need the core package:

```bash
pip install prefect
```

### Running the example

Execute the flow locally with:

```bash
python 01_getting_started/hello_world.py
```

Now let's look at the code!

```python
from prefect import flow


```

## Creating your first flow

Below we define a simple flow that greets someone by name. Notice:

1. The `@flow` decorator transforms a regular Python function into a Prefect flow
2. The function takes a parameter with a default value
3. We use `log_prints=True` to capture print statements as logs

The `log_prints=True` parameter is especially helpful because it:
* Captures **all** `print()` statements inside the flow
* Forwards them to Prefect's logging system
* Makes them visible in the Prefect UI and local logs
* Saves you from having to use a separate logger

```python
@flow(log_prints=True)
def hello(name: str = "Marvin") -> None:
    """Log a friendly greeting."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


```

## Running your flow

Running a flow is as simple as calling the function. Below we demonstrate:

1. Calling with the default parameter
2. Overriding the parameter with a custom value

Every time you run the flow, Prefect tracks the execution and maintains a record 
of the run state, parameters, logs, and more.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 1️⃣ Run the flow with the default parameter
    hello()  # Logs: "Hello, Marvin!"

    # 2️⃣ Run the flow with a different argument
    hello("Arthur")  # Logs: "Hello, Arthur!"

```

### What just happened?

When you ran this script, Prefect:

1. Registered your `hello` function as a flow
2. Created and executed a flow run with the default parameter "Marvin"
3. Captured the print statement as a log entry
4. Created and executed another flow run with the parameter "Arthur"

### Next steps

This simple example only scratches the surface of what Prefect can do. As you 
continue, you'll learn about:

* **Tasks** – Smaller units of work that make up flows
* **Subflows** – Flows that call other flows
* **Retries** – Automatic recovery from failures
* **Deployments** – Schedule and trigger flows from the API
* **Blocks** – Securely store and use configuration

Prefect makes complex workflows and orchestration simple while letting you 
write pure Python code without complex DSLs or configuration formats.
